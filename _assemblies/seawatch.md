At the end of 2014, [Sea-Watch](https://sea-watch.org/ "Homepage Seawatch") grew out of an initiative of volunteers who could not stand on the sidelines witnessing people dying in the Mediterranean Sea any longer. In 2015 this commitment lead to the founding of Sea-Watch e.V. which established a non-governmental maritime search and rescue service and since contributed to the rescue of far more than 37000 people.

Sea-Watch calls for an international, institutionalized maritime search and rescue service with a unambiguous mandate, as it must not remain the task of private organisations instead of countries to provide SAR services in the Mediterranean in perpetuity. They lobby for a legal and #SafePassage for people seeking refuge.

We are happy for Sea-Watch e.V. to be a part of the Open Infrastructure Orbit.

Besides exiting and productive workshops and discussions, we also present talks whicht you can spectate on the Orbit's stage:
