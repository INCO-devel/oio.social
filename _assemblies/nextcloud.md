[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/ "Nextcloud") was created in 2016 as a fork of Owncloud. Since then, [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/ "Nextcloud") has broadened its application from an online storage into a multifunctional modular web platform. This software is free and [open source](https://github.com/nextcloud "source code on GitHub") and is maintained by a circle of developers around Frank Karlitschek and an ever-growing community.

As a part of the Open Infrastructure Orbits, Nextcloud has ensured that past events were a fantastic experience for everyone, and will continue to do so.
The Dome stage of the OIO has hosted workshops, great rounds of discussions and the following talks, which are available at [media.freifunk.net](https://media.freifunk.net/ "media.freifunk.net"):

* [Get your data back under control - 200 things you can do with Nextcloud](https://media.freifunk.net/v/35c3oio-67-get-your-data-back-under-control-200-things-you-can-do-with-nextcloud "Get your data back under control - 200 things you can do with Nextcloud")
