CADUS is a charitable and independent aid organisation. We initiate innovative and sustainable projects focussing on need-based capacity building to help people help themselves. Our team develops projects based on their variegated professional experiences and competences within different lines of work. The interdisciplinary and European wide cooperation with several partners and the consideration of social, sustainable and ecological aspects is understood as a matter of course.

Effective teamwork, interdisciplinary and critical reflection of established NGO-practice, as well as the early involvement of the local communities are central values for CADUS.

Cadus is part of the Open Infrastructure Orbit.
