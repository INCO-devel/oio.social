[Freiwurst](https://freiwurst.net "Freiwurst") has been a part of the Chaos Communication Congresses since 14c3, yet they still hunger for more. The vision of Freiwurst is distributing free [mettwurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mettwurst). Who doesn't fondly remember all those Porkcher won in Lard-Vegas, to be redeemed later. If you haven't heard from it and you care about how the sausage is made, you should visit the Freiwurst-Assembly.

[Freiwurst](https://freiwurst.net "Freiwurst") is a regular part of the Open Infrastructure Orbit - 
in a culinary, artistik and playfull sence, but also by contributing in discussions and presenting talks.
