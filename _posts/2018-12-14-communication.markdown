You can find information concerning the Open Infrastructure Orbit (OIO) at many places on the net.
Therefore we compiled a list of channels to reach the people of the OIO:

 Communication
---------------

The OIO is communicating via Rocket Chat:
[rocket.events.ccc.de/channel/open-infrastructure-orbit](https://rocket.events.ccc.de/channel/open-infrastructure-orbit)

In case you absolutely require an e-mail address, you can use the mailing list: [35c3-orga@freifunk.space](https://lists.freifunk.net/mailman/listinfo/35c3-orga-freifunk.net)


 Fahrplan, Workshops and Talks
----------------------------------

Talks and Workshops are managed in Pretalx: [pretalx.35c3oio.freifunk.space/35c3oio/](https://pretalx.35c3oio.freifunk.space/35c3oio/)

In Pretalx you can also find a Fahrplan with the scheduled program: [pretalx.35c3oio.freifunk.space/35c3oio/schedule/](https://pretalx.35c3oio.freifunk.space/35c3oio/schedule/)

To plan and coordinate we have a regular Mumble at [mumble.freifunk.net](https://mumble.freifunk.net)

The Mumble takes place each Tuesday at 20:00 (UTC+1).
