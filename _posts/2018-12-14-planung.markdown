Here you can find Information on the build-up of the Open Infrastructure Orbit.
In case of confusion or questions please contact us via our [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.events.ccc.de/channel/open-infrastructure-orbit).

The Open Infrastructure Orbit is a safe harbor for all groups, institutions and individuals who are concerning themselves with open infrastructure. While we travel different waters during most of the year, we land together in our habor, our Marina at 35c3 to exchange stories of adventures from the past year and talk about visions for the years to come.

The Marina is located at the center of hall 2, the assembly hall of the 35th Chaos Communication Congresses.

**Please note that the current map might change naturally and reality might differ slightly from our blue prints!**
