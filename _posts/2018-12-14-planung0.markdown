To operate the orbit we require a lot of helping hands. As with the overall Congress, we would welcome Angels and have defined a couple of Angel types:

* Demolition-crew				
* Audio machinist
* Chief engineer				
* Decoration Angel				
* Harbourmaster
* Navigator				
* Stage pilot
* Video maschinist

You can find a description of these tasks in our [Angel System](https://engelsystem.oio.social/angeltypes?action=about).

Please register and take on shifts. For audio and video machinists please come to the stage to get your respective training.  The angel types audio machinist, video machinist and chief engineer qualify for offical Angel hours at 35c3.

If you have questions, please contact us via 35c3-orga@freifunk.space or call 6467!

Unfortunately our Angel system is unable to send e-mails at the moment, so please don't await any responses :)
